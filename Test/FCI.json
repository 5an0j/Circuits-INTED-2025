{"question": "Two metal balls are the same size but one weighs twice as much as the other. The balls are dropped from the roof of a single story building at the same instant of time. What is the time it takes the balls to reach the ground?", "rationale":  "The time it takes the balls to reach the ground below will be about the same for both balls.", "wrong 1": "The time it takes the balls to reach the ground below will be about half as long for the heavier ball as for the lighter one.", "wrong 2": "The time it takes the balls to reach the ground below will be about half as long for the lighter ball as for the heavier one.", "wrong 3": "The time it takes the balls to reach the ground below will be considerably less for the heavier ball, but not necessarily half as long.", "wrong 4": "The time it takes the balls to reach the ground below will be considerably less for the lighter ball, but not necessarily half as long."},
{"question": "A large truck collides head-on with a small compact car. During the collision, what is the relationship between the forces exerted by one object on the other?", "rationale": "During the collision the truck exerts the same amount of force on the car as the car exerts on the truck.", "wrong 1": "During the collision the truck exerts a greater amount of force on the car than the car exerts on the truck.", "wrong 2": "During the collision the car exerts a greater amount of force on the truck than the truck exerts on the car.", "wrong 3": "During the collision neither exerts a force on the other, the car gets smashed simply because it gets in the way of the truck.", "wrong 4": "During the collision the truck exerts a force on the car but the car does not exert a force on the truck."},
{"question": "What happens to a stone dropped from the roof of a single story building to the surface of the earth? ", "rationale": "The stone speeds up because of an almost constant force of gravity acting upon it.", "wrong 1": "The stone reaches a maximum speed quite soon after release and then falls at a constant speed thereafter.", "wrong 2": "The stone speeds up as it falls because the gravitational attraction gets considerably stronger as the stone gets closer to the earth.", "wrong 3": "The stone falls because of the natural tendency of all objects to rest on the surface of the earth.", "wrong 4": "Tne stone falls because of the combined effects of the force of gravity pushing it downward and the force of the air pushing it downward."},
{"question": "The two metal balls of the previous problem roll off a horizontal table with the same speed. What happens in this situation?", "rationale": "In this situation both balls hit the floor at approximately the same horizontal distance from the base of the table.", "wrong 1": "In this situation the heavier ball hits the floor at about half the horizontal distance from the base of the table than does the lighter ball.", "wrong 2": "In this situation the lighter ball hits the floor at about half the horizontal distance from the base of the table than does the heavier ball.", "wrong 3": "In this situation the heavier ball hits the floor considerably closer to the base of the table than the lighter ball, but not necessarily at half the horizontal distance.", "wrong 4": "In this situation the lighter ball hits the floor considerably closer to the base of the table than the heavier ball, but not necessarily at half the horizontal distance."}]
